[[file:20240104T070918--ssh-into-gcp-server__gcp_ssh.org][After you have logged into gcp with ssh]] you can do these steps.

This will allow you to login to your gcp machine from anywhere on the Internet WITHOUT an ssh key, but with username and password.

This method is less secure, but more convenient I guess.

#+begin_src bash
  sudo su -
  vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  # PasswordAuthentication change to yes, save file
  service sshd restart
  adduser username
#+end_src

Try to login with username and password now over putty.

Logout, login with your username and then do

#+begin_src bash
  sudo visudo

  # Locate these lines
  # User privilege specification
  root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
  %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

  # then add this line to make your user be able to login as root

  # Allow the "inst" user to execute any command as root
  username    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
#+end_src

Save and close the file.

Try to login as the user and try to login as root.

You can now even remove the public key from GCP. The user will work.
