E-shop for home-made Lithuanian meat products in Birzai. A client
wanted a quick/cheap and easily maintainable solution, therefore
Wordpress was chosen for this job.

Done by me:
- Communication with the client
- Site design
- Building the site from scratch according to the needs
- Setting up the payment solution
- Hosting the site to the live environment
- Maintaining the site on a monthly basis

My very first client.
