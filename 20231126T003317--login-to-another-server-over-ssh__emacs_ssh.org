First you probably must generate an .ssh key. Or have one in on your machine.
Can do that similarly like described here - [[file:20231214T060558--authenticate-to-git-with-ssh__git_ssh.org][authenticate to git with ssh]].

When ssh keys are setup, then over emacs do:

#+begin_src bash
  /ssh:remote-user@remote.box:/path/to/my/file
#+end_src

will be prompted for password n stuff.
