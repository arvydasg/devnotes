* Intro

* Body

** First attempts

I was trying to do the same with my journey to programming. It started a bit
more than a year ago and since them I was trying to create personal
blog/website.

- First with php - [[https://github.com/arvydasg/gvazdikelis][gvazdikelis]]
- Then with hugo - [[https://github.com/arvydasg/arvydas.dev_hugo][arvydas.dev_hugo]]
- Finally with django - [[https://github.com/arvydasg/django_blog][django_blog]]

* Current setup

[2022-04-17 Sk] I discovered a way to make a website with emacs. [[https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/][Systemcrafters
channel]] has a lot of great material covering just that.

I knew that this is the right way for me to blog, because:

- I can use my emacs shortcuts to write and edit
- I donâ€™t need to reformat text to make it readable for something like CKEditor
  in python [[https://github.com/arvydasg/emacs_blog][django]]. I can just straight up use emacs source blocks, headings,
  text blocks and so on and everything just works,
- I can publish my blog just as easily wit [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]], push straight to Github and
  the changes will be visible immediately in my website,

* Summary

For me, this is the fastest way to blog. I will be using it in the future and
hopefully improve my workflow as I go along.

P.S. Update 2022-08-29. I am creating a hugo blog - AGAIN. Read why - [[https://github.com/arvydasg/emacs_blog][here]].
