- Most flexible and configurable editor in the multiverse.
- It's free, was and [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][forever will be]].
- Complete built-in documentation
- Packaging system, the community that creates them is great
- Keyboard shortcuts similar to Linux shell's. Can't write anything without
  those shortcuts now.
- A wide range of functionality beyond text/code editing, including a

  itself is pretty slow, and you have 10 people near you connecting to the same
  router, it becomes a ridiculous pain to use an IDE.

  why I became a programmer.
