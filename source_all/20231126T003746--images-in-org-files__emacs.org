Okay, so to display inline images you can click 'C-c C-x C-v'

*If you have the image with you:*

To insert an image, do C-u then C-c C-l. easy. if you add a
description, it won't show the image, but rather the description with
an indication of a link.

*If you don't have - use org-download*

M-x org-download-screenshot

then make sure in init file you have specified the directory. If not,
it will save images in your current org file directory. It is good if
you want to export the file to html later and then maybe even send to
someone.
*** resizing images in emacs and html

first of all, add an image as in [[id:7a6e1069-5a0d-4099-9148-9f8d47e863f4][images in emacs]]

then to resize an image, add this to your init:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-image-actual-width nil)
#+end_src

then, above EACH and EVERY image add such thingies:

#+begin_src org
#+attr_html: :width 900px
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[file:images/smutifruti.png]]
#+end_src

and now after C-c C-x C-v - images will display nicely, as per your
request. beautiful
