* June 23rd 2022 - Promotion

Offered to be promoted to IT Engineer, manager agreed. Exactly a month later
was told that that’s not going to happen.

* June 19th 2022 - Want to code

Tired of running though the factory fixing printers - want to program again.

* April 11th 2022 - First IT job

Starting my first IT job ever as an IT Technician in my home town Panevezys.

* Sep 2021 - Self employed web dev
Making wordpress sites for clients. Initially with Elementor, then oxygen
builder, but at the end realizing that all those builders are not for me, I
want to code. That is when I started building various sites with Django.

Got hooked on Emacs. I am not going back to any other code editor. It is
everything, my code editor, my text reader, my calendar, my to-do tool, my note
taking app, my second brain, my website… and so on.

* January 2021 - Going all in

Starting to learn programming with Machine learning course on Coursera. Trying
to find the best code editor.. trying out VIM and loving it. So many
shortcuts - I can jump though things swiftly. Feels like Revit or some kind of
video game(World of Warcraft).

Doing code in place python project.

Deciding that I also don’t want to use Windows as my primary operating system.
Switching to Linux. Trying out different distros, installing and reinstalling
them dozen of times… finally settling down with Ubuntu.

* April 2020 - The idea to program

Quarantine in Bali. Lying in bed. Realizing that I would like to have a job I
can do remotely. I was a computer guy my whole life, playing mostly, but also
fixing minor problems.. Never calling an IT guy to fix something - always doing
it myself.
