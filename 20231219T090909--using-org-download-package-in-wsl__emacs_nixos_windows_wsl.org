[2023-12-19 Tue], when I was setting up [[file:20231215T182523--building-development-notes-website-with-emacs__emacs_websites.org][building development notes website with
Emacs]], I wanted to use =org-download= package and it's functionalities. I
later realized, that as long as I am on WSL, this won't work out of the box for
me.

Simply documenting what I have found below.

Package itself - https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download
Great demo by the author of the package -
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAojpHR-6Uo&ab_channel=abo-abo

since I am on wsl and not ubuntu, but nixos, there seems not to be a software
that can take those screenshots. The tool for that is mentioned in
=org-download-screenshot-method=. Will try to install =scrot=.

After installing =scrot= and =xclicp= on my nixos WSL distro, I still was not
able to make the package work.

This could be a potential workaround -

I think I will live without it.
