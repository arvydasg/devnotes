So last week I have decided to get to know to Denote package. Having
lots of free time, I realized that I do not like my notes
structure. Maybe Denote will help with that.

This whole Denote setup has taken way more time and effort than I
expected. Reinstalling Emacs to a newer version, fixing wsl, reporting
buts to Microsoft's wslg team, remaking my emacs configuration,
transporting all my notes to denote style notes...


I can say that the best introduction to Denote is here -
https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-06-18-denote-demo/

By the author himself. It is nice to use the tool that was created by
the person I "know".

So yeah, intro above, docs here - https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote

Some more about denote features I write here - [[denote:20231125T212326][denote features]]
