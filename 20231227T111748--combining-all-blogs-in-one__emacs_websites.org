#+STARTUP:    overview

Currently, [2023-12-27 Wed] everything works as it should.

- one place to store denotes devnotes - "org" folder
- one place to store build scripts - "build" folder
- one place to store exported html files - "html" folder

A few annoying things about this way of working:

- html files are in the same repo, I never need them when looking for files,
  but they are always in a way. During simple or rg searches.
- Also when I make a change to an org file and re-export - bunch of html files
  get changed too(id's of headings), so I when I want to commit a change of an
  org file - I have to make sure I don't accidentally commit html files as well
- This repo does not contain other blog attempts and their org
  files(arvydas.dev, gvazdikelis, emacs_blog, etc). I want everything to be in
  one place

Way's to fix/improve:

1. Create a new branch for "devnotes" repo called
   =2023_12_27_before_all_blog_merge=, this will hold the current
   [2023-12-27 Wed] state of the devnotes repo
2. move all the files from
   https://github.com/arvydasg/arvydasg.github.io_blog_content to devnotes,
   delete the repo
3. move all the content from https://github.com/arvydasg/codeacademy to
   devnotes, delete the repo
4. move certain/needed(if something can be shows that I worked on, idk) files
   from https://github.com/arvydasg/pkc_wiki/tree/master/CONTENT/pkc, don't
   delete the repo
5. reuse https://github.com/arvydasg/arvydasg.github.io repo to store all html
   in one place(first make sure that )
6. review all the commits and write the steps you took here
