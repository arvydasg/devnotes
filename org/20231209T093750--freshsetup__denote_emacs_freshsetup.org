After creating a new dotfiles directory - [[denote:20231209T080431][moving emacsd into dotfiles repo]] I
realized there is a need to set up everything automatically on the new machine
IF the user so desires.

For that I have created a script called "freshsetup.sh" in dotfiles
directory. When it is launched, it does everything I need.
