I would really like to have some actual data to work with, but I can
not find any that I would 1-know how to read, 2-know how to work with,
3-would not get frustrated just by looking at csv file full of digits
and and commas.

Creating my own dataset just by typing words and numbers in a google
sheet is possible(and probably I will end up doing that and using what
I come up with for the next two weeks), but... I forgot what I wanted
to say.

The thing is, according to my "plan" I am supposed to be learning
about excel and statistics right now, but for some reason as I watch a
tutorial or read a book (think stats) I come up to a road block which
tells me that to continue you need to know how to use python or how to
use excel. 1-I dont know how to use python and I am supposed to learn
in in 2 weeks(according to my plan :D) and 2-I dont have excel on my
computer (need to install in on linux through vine after finding a
free ISO...) and google sheets lacks some functions that I see
tutorials about...

Again, I don't feel that I am progressing anywhere, I am just looking
at various ways to get data, learning about various types of data and
basically finding out ways of how NOT to start learning DS :D But it's
alright, I'll get there.

Lets focus on excel for the rest of today. 16:20

Filters in excel a quite useful.

*Filters* in - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMlTDXPEjag&t=21s][excel]] are quite useful. Watching in 1.5x speed just to
get an idea of what is possible. Totals, nice. Transform your data
into a table to get an easy totals/averages and so on. You get not
only filering options but also your forumulas or charts referencing
the data - they both get updated. Kay, will keep in mind.

Formulas and Functions by the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0Qk63z2ZY][guy]] who works at Microsoft :D.

Been seeing median here and there, so here is a refresher:

*Concatenate* - =CONCAT(x1,x2) takes value from one row, then from the
other one that you selec and separate with comman and puts them
together in one "langeli".

*If* - =IF(D13="smile", "yay", "boo") good times Csongor, good times ;) IF
a field equals to a word "smile", the returned value will be "yay", if
the field equals to anything else than "smile", returns the value
"boo".

*Countif* - Selecting a range of values and asking the formula to
calculate how many instances that we have specied are in the given
range. For example. =COUNTIF(B1:G7, 1) formula presents me with a
number that tells me how many numbers "1" are in the field that I
asked to look in.

*Vlookup* - things are getting more interesting. So Vlookup looks at the
table, lest say the table has two values... you know, let me just put
an image rly quick (more vim and html practice on top of that).

So the formula that found out the favorite color of ciongibongi is as
such - =VLOOKUP(D18,D15:E18,2,FALSE)

*Sumif* - is a nice function I guess but wont make an example, I am
aware of it alright.

p.s. damn it takes a lot of time to write this html document in a
proper way. I sometimes miss Word document, but sometimes I don't. Vim
has it's own advantages, but I am new with it so I am a little bit
slow. Learned how to yank, paste a word or a whole line today.
