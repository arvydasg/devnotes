To remove all WSL distributions and disable the WSL feature on your Windows machine, follow these steps:

Remove WSL Distributions:
Open PowerShell as Administrator:
Right-click on the Start menu, select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Windows Terminal (Admin)".

List Installed WSL Distributions:
Run the following command to list all installed WSL distributions:

powershell
Copy code
wsl --list --verbose
Uninstall WSL Distributions:
For each installed distribution, use the following command to uninstall it:

powershell
Copy code
wsl --unregister <DistributionName>
Replace <DistributionName> with the name of each installed distribution listed by the previous command.

Remove Remaining WSL Files:
Open File Explorer and navigate to the directory where WSL stores its data. By default, it's usually located at C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Packages. Look for folders related to WSL and delete them.

Disable WSL Feature:
Turn Off WSL via PowerShell:
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

powershell
Copy code
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
This command disables the WSL feature on your system.

Restart Your Computer:
After performing these steps, restart your computer to ensure that the changes take effect.

Starting Fresh:
After disabling WSL and removing all distributions, if you wish to start fresh with WSL:

Enable WSL Again:
Follow the steps to enable WSL on your Windows machine. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

powershell
Copy code
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
Install a New WSL Distribution:
After re-enabling WSL, you can install a new Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store or by using wsl --install. Choose the Linux distribution you prefer and follow the installation steps.

By following these steps, you can effectively remove all WSL distributions and disable the WSL feature on your Windows machine. Then, if needed, you can start fresh by enabling WSL again and installing a new Linux distribution.

Linux GUI apps are only supported with WSL 2 and will not work with a Linux distribution configured for WSL 1. Read about how to change your distribution from WSL 1 to WSL 2.
