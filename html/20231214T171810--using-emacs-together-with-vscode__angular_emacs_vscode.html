<p>
Don't remember where it is from, but I quote everything what is written below:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I use Emacs for writing prose and general computing.
</p>

<p>
But, with respect to programming, I now use both Emacs and VSCode <b>at the same
time for the same files/projects</b>. (Although predominantly Emacs).
</p>

<p>
Some months ago, I started working professionally on a Typescript/Angular
project. And my co-workers, of course, use VSCode.
</p>

<p>
Initially, I kept using Emacs. After a while, seeing the several ide features
(go to definition, show documentation, etc.) that my colleagues were using, I
decided to give VSCode a serious try and I used it to write Typescript/Angular
for a whole month or so.
</p>

<p>
After that, I tried to see whether I could get similar functionalities in
Emacs. I tried both LSP Mode and Eglot. After some fighting, I had a quite
usable LSP Mode with the ide features I wanted. Not as polished as VSCode, but
totally usable. (Eglot was very nice, but I wanted to try ESLint and it looks
like with Eglot, atm, you cannot have multiple LSP servers running for the same
buffer.)
</p>

<p>
Instead of going back to Emacs 100%, I decided to try a hybrid approach, which
has been very pleasant so far. I use emacs most of the time, but when I feel
that VSCode can offer some additional help I turn to it and then go back to
Emacs. To make the process smooth I wrote some lines of elisp that make VSCode
open the same file I am currently editing, at the same line and the same
column. I have it bound to C-Caps (Actually it's C-Escape, because I have
Escape remapped to Caps systemwise). When I want, then, I hit a key, VSCode
appears, with the cursor placed exactly where Emacs cursor was, I do what I
want to do, save if necessary, and switch back to Emacs. I usually keep VSCode
already open in the same project, to allow things to be faster. Here is the
elisp:

<p>
I would also like to able to open Emacs from VSCode, remaining in the same
file, same line and column, too. Does anyone know how to do that? I couldn't be
bothered, so far&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Assuming that Emacs is better than VSCode at certain things (say, text-editing,
keyboard-macros, extensibility on the fly) and VSCode is better than Emacs (at
least, non-relevantly extended Emacs) at other things (say, code
navigation/visualization and certain code-completions), using both at the same
time is, I think, an approach that deserves some thought.
