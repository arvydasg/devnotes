Back in the days when I used to install Linux as a main OS and had to install
all the packages one by one.

Before I knew that I can create scripts that do that for me with one click.
TODO add freshsetup things and scripts.

Before I knew about [[file:20231211T151427--first-nixos-installation__nixos.org][nixos]].

All this knowledge has paid off of course, it lead me to my second IT related
job :)

Here are the steps anyway:
