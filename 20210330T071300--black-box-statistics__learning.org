#+STARTUP:    overview

Excited about starting to learn python on April 1st, so thought I will
try to look into something I should have looked into during this whole
month of March... Last day huh. Like always. Hm.. anyway, some black
boxing of some statistics terms.

*MEAN* - the average of the numbeers. Add up all numbers, divide by how
many numbesr there are.

*MEDIAN* - middle of a sorted list of numbers. If can't find the middle
number, add the 2 close ones and divide them by two.

*MODE* - Numbers in order, count how many of each number, which appears
most often is the mode. Two modes - bimodal. Grouping is useful also.

*VARIANCE* + (standard deviation) - the average of the squared
differences from the Mean. [[https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html][Dogs]].

*IQR* - interquartile range - numbers in order, find median. Take from
both sides medians again and then minus one from the other, you get
the IQR.

*CORRELATION and CAUSALITY* - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROpbdO-gRUo][explanation Khan]].

MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD - looks cool. Finding the best fit

Was learning more statistics, feeling bad that I left it behind. Have
some time before the python course that I registered for, so will
catch up with stats.

Was looking at Khan accademy statistics course and found some things
that I struggle with. The first paragraph presented the two way table
and it was so confusing for me. The second day I crcked it.

Okay back to the business. Since I dont have a proper notebook that I
dream about, I will just write my notes here and improve my vim and
html skils at the same time.

Point means one or more value is there, then other side the same, then
the meat of the distribution is where the box is. Line is the median -
the middle number. Distribution is skewed to the left. more values on
the left.

*Outlier* - data point is way off from all the other data points.

*Cluster* - group of data. 0-2 days is a cluster for example.

*Standard deviation* - how far on average we are form the mean. Cool,
makes sense in the last sentence of [[https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-population/v/range-variance-and-standard-deviation-as-measures-of-dispersion?modal=1][This video]]

Few notes on variance and how to find it. From the video above as
well. Just wannah have those here.
