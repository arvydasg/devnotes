KEY - linking roam notes with id's in html -

I have found org-roam to be nice to use as I remember, but file naming was
a little strange + I remember I did not like he idea of having a database to
store all the links between notes. Also I was not really using the full
potential and functionalities(graphs, backlinks, etc) that it offered.

That is why, when the idea of having a "second-brain" started to creep towards
me, I choose denote. TODO-explain why
