Ok let me think out real quick. I have got around 10 python scripts that I
would like to share to my website for people to interract. Part of the scrips
will require only to enter a number and view the result. Others will require to
upload files for the script to be ran.. There will be some sort of
communication between the user and the python program in the website.

I think it would be cool to do that so I could show my projets to friends and
family members.

So far I have seen many tools for simialr tasks. Something that starts with B..
django and flask were mentioned I think, some other frameworks or how to call
them.

Just have to see which one works with the most basic code in my now php website
and then upload the rest.

Been doing some python exercises form Code in Place and I came up to [[https://www.w3schools.com/python/][w3schools]]
with a hope to find an explanation how to work with functions inside other
functions, reuse their returned information and so on. (that would be really
useful for me when working wiht images). So I came up to this python
interpreter I can say? It runs the code that w3schools asks us to run, BUT if I
put my own code - it doesn't execute.

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600

So, if w3schools cant make it work properly, like.. I am thinking now.. make a
browser have all the functions that python has...? Is it even possible? Well,
definitely not for me, not for now. I will stick to making a blog wiht all the
cool functions that I learned so I can execute them anywhere, from anyones
computer just by looking up on my website.

Wrote the same question again - running python script in the browser. Opened
like 10-15 links, will watch them all and see if I find something suitable for
myself. If not - I will just upload the code and that's it.

    - Brython - aims to replace Javascript for web scripting. It allows you to
      directly use Python Scripts on a webpage to handle DOM (Document Object
      Model) elements and events, all using our favorite language Python.
    - Flask - deploying python script as a flash app to google app engine.
      Looks promising, user gets to put his input, then getting the result in
      an html page. Sounds good to me, but is it free tho? But first let me
      finish checking the other 15 opened solutions.
    - Python anywhere - not free
    - Anvil - seems free
    - cgitb" library?
    - Trinket is a python interpreter for a website. Also an option? Works when
      chaning inches to feet, but when I tried to run an image editing script,
      it told me that SimpleImage can not be imported. Upsy daisy.

Okay, most likely I will not try to get any interpreters or apps to run my
scripts on my website. Placing just the code itself will suffice for now and
when I learn little bit more about python django, flask and stuff like this, I
will come back to this post and use the methods tht I found to host and use my
scripts online. By that time I will probably have some coool scripts :p Looking
forward to that. Okay, bye for now. Going to do some web dev stuff :)
