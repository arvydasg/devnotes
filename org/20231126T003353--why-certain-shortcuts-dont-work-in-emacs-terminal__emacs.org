You’re using Emacs inside of a terminal, and terminals have a much more limited
set of keystrokes that they can communicate. This is because historically
terminals simply had fewer keys on their keyboards, and because not all
combinations of keys were thought to be useful.

Some terminal emulators, starting with XTerm, have added new escape sequences
that are capable of communicating the full range of key combinations possible
on modern keyboards. Emacs will automatically recognize these escape sequences,
so if your terminal emulator supports them then you have a solution. If it
doesn’t perhaps you can use XTerm instead.
