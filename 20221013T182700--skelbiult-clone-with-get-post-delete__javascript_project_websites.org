* Introduction

Today I had a final front-end part Codeacademy task. I was asked to use GET,
POST and DELETE requests while taking design and layout inspirations from
skelbiu.lt.

The goal was not to use any javascript frameworks. I have also used as much
pure html/css as possible, although for the form, I have decided to use
Bootstrap.

Here is a live codeacademy task itself - [[./media/Baigiamoji_uzduotis.pdf][Baigiamoji uzduotis]].

* The Process

- I have started with researching the skelbiu.lt page, figuring out how much of
  the cloning I can do from it.
- I then created an API for the project with [[https://mockapi.io/][mockapi]] and filled it with some
  dummy data.
- Using the dummy data I have coded the GET, POST, DELETE requests with Vanilla
  Javascrip, not using any frameworks and made sure they are displayed in the
  browser.
- Assigned localstorage values to each item so I can redirect to individual
  item pages.
- Made sure the styles match those of skelbiu.lt

* Conclusion

Here is a link to my [[https://arvydas.dev/codeacademy/javascript/skelbiult/index.html][Skelbiu.lt clone]](give it a few seconds to load, this api
service can sometimes be slow :) ).

Here is a link to the actual [[https://www.skelbiu.lt/][skelbiu.lt]] page.

Working with API’s, fetchign and updating data is one of the most intersting
things that I have done with JavaScript so far. I am happy I have learned this
skill, I can see many project ideas that can be done in a similar passion, with
API’s and GET, POST requests, I just wish I had more time to play with these :)
