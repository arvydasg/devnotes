* Display images in org files

To display inline images in org buffer after you have placed some, click =C-c
C-x C-v=.

* If you have the image with you

To insert an image, do C-u then C-c C-l. easy. if you add a
description, it won't show the image, but rather the description with
an indication of a link.

[2023-12-14 Thu] or what I use now is yasnippet that looks like such, that is
the yasnippet template:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  #+attr_html: :width 800px
  #+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
  [[./static/images/.png]]
#+end_src

Don't forget to modify the path of the image and it will display it.

This - #+attr_html: - tells how wide the image should look *in the browser*.
This - +ATTR_ORG - tells how wide the image should look *in the org file inside
emacs* when you do =org-toggle-inline-images=.

* Resizing images in emacs and html

To resize an image, add this to your init:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-image-actual-width nil)
#+end_src

Then, above EACH and EVERY image add such lines:

#+begin_src org
#+attr_html: :width 900px
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[file:images/smutifruti.png]]
#+end_src

and now after C-c C-x C-v - images will display nicely, as per your request.
Beautiful.

And then make sure to add this to your css so the image would not spill out of
the container borders:

#+begin_src css
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }
#+end_src

* If you don't have an image and want to insert a screenshot

Use ~org-download~ package. After you install it, run =M-x
org-download-screenshot=.

Then make sure in init file you have specified the directory. If not, it will
save images in your current org file directory. It is good if you want to
export the file to html later and then maybe even send to someone.
