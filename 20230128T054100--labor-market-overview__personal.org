* Intro

Had a meeting with Laura from CodeAcademy. It is finally time to get for my
dream job, I am ready!

* Python in Lithuania
ppp
Python in Lithuania is not that widely used, perhaps in Big Data or
Automation.

** Positions after this course for me could be as:
  - Data Engineer/Scientist
  - Automation Specialist
  - Robotics Process Automation / RPA Specialist
  - Testing/QA
  - ~DEVOPS ENGINEER~ (junior/entry level). (I think this would suite
    me best, since I have experience as IT technician where I was
    involved with deploying and managing various solutions. I could be
    a better candidate instead of anyone from the street with no IT
    experience. Automatization, making systems work, that's what I do
    on a daily basis and this is what I enjoy)

** Biggest Python companies in Lithuania

Here is a list of biggest python companies in Lithuania. Should not
forget to introduce myself to each and every one of them :)

According to Laura, biggest salaries with python come from Big Data(should look
into in in the future, but first, let's get a foot inside programming role).

* Job search

There options are endless.

** What is junior anyway?

Hire people with a lot of potential, that will be and grow with you in
a long run and not just take someone Super Senior, burn them out in 6
months and get another one.

** I should first of all mention, that I am self taught

I got an advice from a friend to mention that I am a self taught
developer first. It will show that I have initiative, discipline,
motivation, that I am curious about learning new things, I can work
without anyone forcing.

And only then mention that I took CodeAcademy courses to deepen my
knowledge and fill all the knowledge gaps that I might have missed
while learning programming by myself.

o apie mokyklą kai pasakosi, rodys, kad išsamiai įsigilinai į Python,
tikriausiai nebus spragų žiniose ir t.t.

** Don't get scared if you see something unfamiliar in a job ad

IMPORTANT: Apply to jobs that you aren’t qualified for!

When a hiring manager creates a job listing, they put down everything
under the sun that they can think of that would be a “nice to have”.
In fact, companies are rarely EVER able to find a candidate that has
all the requirements.

But it is a good idea nevertheless to at least google the technologies
listed so you are aware why/where/for what purpose they are used.

Believe it or not it is a very bad idea for you to take a job that you
are fully qualified for because there will be no room for growth.
Hiring managers know this as well.

You will be hired based on if you match most or some of the job
requirements and how well you do in the interview as far as
friendliness, punctuality, enthusiasm, confidence, communication
skills, and ability to convince them that you are a good fit for the
team.

** Instead of new job - agree with current workplace

One option that CodeAcademy agrees upon is for me to work
as an IT Technician for 50% of the time and the rest 50% of the time
as a programmer. But that also has to be agreed upon with my
workplace.

Not sure if the workplace would agree, since I was strictly told there
is no "Programming" position.

** LinkedIn

Use LinkedIn well and after a while you won't be looking for jobs but
jobs will be looking for you :)

** Hackathons

Hackathons - business problem, programmer teams, creating solutions. A
good way to network and test your knowledge over a weekend in Vilnius.

** Freelancing

Could freelance.. I thought about it, yes, even tried in the past, but
this area seemed so THICK and full of competition(in my WordPress
times). Can be a good introduction to programming jobs or keep this
extra source of income and interesting jobs in the future as well.
Kind of best way if I want freedom in my life.

** Responding to job ads

A few main things I took is:
- if there is a job ad on job ad site - it's already too late, the
  company desperately needs a person.
- It is better to send the CV/Introduction/get in touch with HR BEFORE
  they create any jobs ads. They will get a chance to LOOK at your CV,
  and that is huge. If you are one in 50 candidates, your cv more
  often than not will not be viewed at all.
- HR knows about current positions and FUTURE positions, so if you
  present yourself in advance, they might not need you now, but might
  remember you in the future.. and they will already know you :)
  Instead of doing all the dirty job of creating a job ad - looking
  for candidates and so on - they might ping you on LinkedIn.
- Try to contact the manager of the department. If I was a manager and
  someone would write to me personally wanting to fill a position, I
  would gladly read this person's CV.
- Write to HR recruiters - "Hello, I want to change a sphere I am
  working on, perhaps you got something for me?". Tell a bit about
  yourself also.

** Github hygiene

I should definitely clean up my Github account:

- Remove smaller projects
- Check comments/readmes for inappropriate words, etc.
- Half lithuanian, half english? - no good.
- Overall "hygiene" of the profile?
