Here I will write the tips that I found and that I use when building a Django
project.

* Instead of /admin change to smth else URL Django

For security. Everyone knows that if its a django project, it will have an
admin page

* Use environment variables

- for secret key
- for database name/location
- api keys
- other things if needed

* Use postgres db

Kind of default ageed db to use with Django

* Use two different settings files

One for prod another for acc(test) environment

Like described in here TODO split django settings into multiple files(TODO - add
from notes)
