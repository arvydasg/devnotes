#+STARTUP:    overview

A year or so ago I had to set up Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics to a
few of my client websites for marketing purposes. I have not documented the
process back then, but will do so now as I am setting it up for ~this~ site.
(Yes, I know that you have been here ;) )

* Setup GTM(Google Tag Manager)

It will act as single place where you put all your tags in the future. Good for
managing and debugging.

- Go to https://tagmanager.google.com page and create an account
- Create a container
- Add the provided tags to your source code ~head~ section and at the top of
  ~body~ section.
- Make sure when you go to ~Tag-assistant~ - you can connect to your site and
  the data flows.

* Setup GA(Google Analytics)

- Create an account in https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/
- Create a property for your specific website
- You might get such a message "Universal Analytics properties will stop
  collecting data starting 1 July 2023. Itâ€™s recommended that you create a
  Google Analytics 4 property instead." You can ignore it, but make sure you
  are creating Google Analytics 4 property. Remember this for the later steps.
- Set up Data Streams to start collecting data
- Get the MEASUREMENT ID, in my case it's something similar to ~G-NYYXE875PQ~

* Back to GTM

- Go to Tags, clink on new, tag configuration
- Select Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration
- Add your MEASUREMENT ID into the provided field
- In the same page - click on trigger field to add a new trigger
- Choose "All Pages"
- Name your tag, for example "GA4 Configuration - G-NYYXE875PQ"
- Save the tag
- Go to the preview mode again, upon your page refresh you now see the
  "debugger active" and next to "Tags Fired" you will see your tag name "GA4
  Configuration - G-NYYXE875PQ", the data should get transmitted. Nice and
  easy.
- While still in preview mode, go to Google Analytics admin site, find "Debug
  view" in one of the sidebars and open it.
- You will see the data flowing in real time from your preview mode to your GA4
  tag. Pretty cool. This allows you to debug interactions to your website on a
  more granular level.
- You can(or anyone else can) install a "Google Analytics Debugger" extension
  to their browser and when they navigate through your page - your debugger
  view will see those changes.
- Go back to your main admin GTM site - click on "Submit" to save your changes
  to the environment. In the "Version field" field enter "Installed GA4" for
  example and click ~Publish~.

  If everything went successfully, you can go to you GA admin page, choose
  Reports -> Real-Time and you should see something like this :)

  Congrats!

  p.s.

  If you dont see the data just yet, be patient, it should appear sooner than
  later.
