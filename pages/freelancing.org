Over the past few years I've worked as a freelance software developer.
I've worked with individuals and small businesses.

My tech stack is usually Python, Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript,
sometimes WordPress.

* Why hire me?
I have many great relationships with all of my clients. I prioritise
maintaining open and clear communication, and offer not only technical
expertise but also a business oriented mindset. Every decision is made
through a lens of achieving results that impact the business.

If you'd like to work with me, please [[mailto:arvydas.gaspa@gmail.com][get in touch]].
