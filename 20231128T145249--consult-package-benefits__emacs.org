- Galiu paturbinti C-x b, kad rodytu man buffer contenta. Nice.
- =consult-grep= - find whateveryouwant in a current PROJECT(git project).
- =consul-man= - look for ANYTHING in LINUX MANUAL PAGE. WTF.
- =consult-info= - find ANYTHING in your installed packages manuals...
- =consult-bookmark= - set a bookmark in a location and then easily jump to it
  later... almost like my org find agenda file.
- =consult-theme= - change and try themes on the fly. wtf.
- =consult-flymake=???????????????????? Labadiena
- =consult-goto-line= - cool
- =consult-outline/consult-org-headings= - look through ORG file outlines.
  Through all the headings. Thats cool when in a large document! That's like a
  table of contents for you.
- =consult-org-agenda=??? must try that out
- =consult-project-buffer= - look only through opened files in the project.
- =M-s= is a big one!
- =M-s e= for example shows you all the search functions you previously typed
  for. Nice.
- =M-g i= - look for functions inside the file!!!
- =C-u M-s g= - first specify the directory and then do the search. Great,
  works like regular RG.

bookmarks is another cool thing.. can set them and then later jump to them with
c-x b and pressing m then SPACE and you will have a list of bookmarks!!
