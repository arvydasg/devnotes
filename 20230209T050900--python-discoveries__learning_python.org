Here, whenever I will remember, I will be writing what I have
discovered about Python when creating one project or the other.

Functionalities that took me a long time to discover and when I
finally did - it helped me a lot.

First of all I don't want to forget about these functions, second of
all - I would like to share them with you.

* Scope

You can assign a returned value from functions to a variable

I was returning a value from function, wanted to use it another
function. I had to assign the returned value to a function first and
only then I could use it. SCOPE is the important word here.

Thanks to Karina
* f"" string > templates

Qrcode pkc

I had to recreate a QR code template that is created with batch to a
program in python(more controls, better gui, etc).

So I have chosen something like [[https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html?highlight=safe_substitute#string.Template.safe_substitute][this]] for this task. Had a massive
template with certain strings that had to be replaced. All is good,
managed to make it work, but whenever I would have a: ~9999$A99999~ my
delimiter and value that $A surrounded with other symbols - the
delimiter would not be replaced with what I have described.

~f"99999{A}99999"~ has no problem doing that, this is why I have chosen
it for this project.

* flask dispachermiddleware

Module and imports. Running multiple flask apps

For [[https://arvydas.dev/2023-02-06-run-multiple-flask-applications-from-the-same-server.html][this]] project [[https://github.com/arvydasg/flask_projects/tree/master/II][here]].

even though the data.py is in basically the same location as main.py -
I still had to import all the modules from root.. ~from II.web_app.data
import data~. This was strange.

* Python set()

The set() function creates a set. No repeating values.

#+begin_src python
  list_numbers = [1,2,3,4,2,5,5,1]

  # create set from list
  numbers_set = set(list_numbers)

  print(numbers_set)
#+end_src

Useful when I wanted to extract all authors in a list ONCE.

Amazing, thanks to Karina.

* listdir vs chdir

This one confused me. I ran a for loop similar to this:

#+begin_src python
  x = ./Dropbox
  dir = os.listdir(x)
  print(dir)

  for file in dir:
      # do this and that
#+end_src

and I kept wondering why my for loops runs IN THE directory where this
script is placed(I printed it out, it knows the dir I want) and not in
the directory that I specified in x.

Now it seems obvious, but I simply should have changed the director to
the specified one before running the for loop.

something similar to this:

#+begin_src python
  for file in os.listdir(os.chdir(x)):
#+end_src
