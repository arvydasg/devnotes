Two files. One is tasks.org, another is somedaymaybe.org

in tasks file - headings by projects(lifeapi, quotes, CDP, etc).

in somedaymaybe file - hadings by topic(buy, watch, movies, etc).

Cpture templates + agenda commands are related to those

Leaving the tasks inside the tasks, at the bottom(so I could see how many tasks
are left and how many I have completed)
