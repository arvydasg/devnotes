Being awake - creates toxic products. Sleep - washes out of toxins.
Brains way to keep it clean and healthy.

Poison that doesn't make us think clear. Washing out toxins. Some,
including me, would sacrifice sleep to cram more info hoping to learn
more effectively and faster. Damn I've been learning the wrong way.
Glad to find this information, which makes sense, to help me with my
furhter learning.

Brain tidies up the learning material, deepens the neural patterns and
strengthens them. Complete deactivation of “you” helps me
unconsciously sort of the material. Think what you are learning
about - you might dream about it. Dreaming about what you are
studying - helps you to understand the material. Wow.

Allows the brain a chance to rehearse difficult material -- going over
and over the tougher aspects of what you are trying to learn.

Trying to study without having slept the night before is like trying
to think with POISON on the brain. NOOOOOO.

* Exercise

And just as importantly, exercise is surprisingly valuable in helping
to improve both our memory and our ability to learn.

Jogging etc, helps to come up with new thoughts and etc unconscious
thoughts bubble into. The only problem is to remember those
ideas.Taking notes to remember what he was thinking about doing the
run.

Your brain needs that moment of pause to use your muscles rather than
your brain to be able to process that information and get the neurons
working on it.

Be in a creative environment with other people. Might seem the
contrary compared with the painter guy, closing yourself up and stuff.
But he find its easier for him to learn stuff when he is discussing
new ideas and trying to explain them the process (**** this is really
important I think to bounce my ideas off from them…I like that as
well).

"Isolating ourselves…” BUT - For many years the scientific view of the
brain was that once our brain was mature the neurons we had could be
strengthened with learning but new neurons couldn’t develop as we
aged. A lot of people still believe this is true, which creates a
pretty bleak outlook as they get older. But now scientists have better
methods of watching the brain in action and they can see that our
brains develop new neurons while we sleep, when we surround ourselves
with stimulating environments and people - and when we exercise!
Interestingly, even if we don't have a stimulating environment
exercise still assists our brains in growing new neurons. Good news
for introverts.

** Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski dude

2 things at once - not productive. Switching from one to the other is
possible apparently. But not as productive.

You are born with a specific amount of neurons. Rich environment -
helpful. So you can actively improve. Like a rat example.

Exercise also increases that, same like being with many rats instead
of shutting yourself in a box and becoming passive.

Passion, persistence > smart

Don't get hung up on one question, jump to the next one. Answers might
come later. Make it a dance.
