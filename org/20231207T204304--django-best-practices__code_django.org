Here I will write the tips that I found and that I use when building a django
project.

* Instead of /admin change to smth else URL django
for security. Everyone knows that if its a django project, it will have an
admin page

* use environment variables
- for secret key
- for database name/location
- api keys
- other things if needed

* use postgres db

kind of default ageed db to use with django

* use two different settings files

one for prod another for acc(test) environment

like described in here [[denote:20231125T223516][split django settings into multiple files]]
