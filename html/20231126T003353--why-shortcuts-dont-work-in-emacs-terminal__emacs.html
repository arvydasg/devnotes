<p>
You’re using Emacs inside of a terminal, and terminals have a much
more limited set of keystrokes that they can communicate. This is
because historically terminals simply had fewer keys on their
keyboards, and because not all combinations of keys were thought to be
useful.
</p>

<p>
Some terminal emulators, starting with XTerm, have added new escape
sequences that are capable of communicating the full range of key
combinations possible on modern keyboards. Emacs will automatically
recognize these escape sequences, so if your terminal emulator
supports them then you have a solution. If it doesn’t perhaps you can
use XTerm instead.
