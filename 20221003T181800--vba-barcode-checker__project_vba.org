* A Complaint

PKC group has received a complaint regarding one process due to which
nonconformity appeared in some products.

I was asked to make something so ensure the nonconformity in the process does
not repeat.

* Estonian Code

I ended up looking through 12 years old [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/][VBA]] code which had no documentation,
most of the code was in Estonian and itâ€™s the developer did not want to touch
his code anymore.

I took the challenge, read through the code, saw the connections, googled a lot
and finally added my own pieces of code to get the desired outcome. I have
added a few barcodes to necessary places.

* Created a whole app with a language I have never worked before

I then created a VBA app to scan those barcodes with and instructed the shift
leaders as well as other employers to use the app.

This app was implemented in 3 departments in Panevezys site, there are plans of
launching it in other sites in Lithuania as well.

The barcodes scanned with the app had to be made available for Quality personel
to check. I have created a shell script that runs at 13:00 on a daily basis and
copies the needed file from the user machine to a location on the server so it
can be accesssed.

* Conclusion

During this project I went from not knowing anything about VBA to coding a
fully functional app wiht it that is now used on a daily basis and helps to
prevent future nonconformities that can be made by packing departments all
around PKC.
