** Emacs installation on LINUX (senas)
Before even doing anything, in your .emacs.d/init.el file add all this info --
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX9PKK3EMaw&t
*** susikuriam baze - init.el
   Jeigu nauja sistema, tai reikia pirma eiti i .emacs.d ir susikurti init.el faila.
 /home/azeubu/Dropbox/org/  Jis bus pagrindinis, ten desim tai:

        (require 'package)
     (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/npackages/"))
     (package-initialize)

     ;; Bootstrap 'use-package
     (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
       (package-refresh-contents)
       (package-install 'use-package))

     (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "myinit.org"))

*** susikuriam sutrauka - myinit.org
   vel, .emacs.d folderiuke sukuriam myinit.org

   (require 'package)
   (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
   (add-to-list 'package-archives
   '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
   (package-initialize)

   ;; Bootstrap 'use-package
   (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
   (package-refresh-contents)
   (package-install 'use-package))
*** Totally new thingy krc 2021-12-06 - veikia su dropbox
   sudo apt install emacs
   atsidarai .emacs.d, susikuri init.el faila
   ikeli visa sita content

   ;; Initialize package sources
   (require 'package)

   (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
   ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
   ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

   (package-initialize)
   (unless package-archive-contents
   (package-refresh-contents))

   CIA PADARAI package-refresh-contents
   perkrauni emacs, ziuri ar viskas ok
   go and check M-x list-packages
   PAMEGINK M-x package install use- ir jeigu meta ka nors - gerai, reiskia pasiruoses kitam zingsniui

   open init.el ir ikelk

   (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
   (package-refresh-contents)
   (package-install 'use-package))

   reload emacs, jeigu viskas veikia- einam sekanti zingsni

   susikurk dropboxe vieta kur nori kelti emacs failus.
   susikurk ten myinit.org IR TAIP PAT myinit.el

   i myinit.org ikelk sita content

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   ;; Thanks, but no thanks
   (setq inhibit-startup-message t)


   (menu-bar-mode -1)            ; Disable the menu bar
   (tool-bar-mode -1)          ; Disable the toolbar
   (tooltip-mode -1)           ; Disable tooltips
   (set-fringe-mode 10)       ; Give some breathing room

   ;; Set up the visible bell
   (setq visible-bell t)
   (load-theme 'tango-dark)
   #+END_SRC

   turn off emacs, turn on.

   Jeigu pasikeicia theme - tu ready to go. jeigu ne, paziurek ar myinit.el turi ta pati content kaip org.

   Blogiausiu atveju nueik i temp_emacs ir copy files from there.

   zodziu, viskas okei dabar. galesiu su Jokubu pasneketi apie wordpress ir core files and etc ir editint juos normaliai.
   vaziuoju pas Julyte dabar, ji siek tiek pyksta manau kad isejau paciam smuti fruti marketingo sukuryje daryti savo reikaliuku.
   einu pareklaminti facebook, darysim zaidima

    SELECT RECTANGLE!! and delete. so useful with CSV tables now.

    In Emacs-24.4, the rectangle commands are alo made available via rectangular
    selection: hit C-x SPC and then move around to select a rectangle (it should
    be highlighted visually), after which you can use the usual C-w to remove it.

    gg pman. again with emacs most of the day.. Julyte might come namo
    earlier soon and what have you been doing? emacs lol.

          Can not hold myself from trying to configure it the way I want and the way
          it looks meaningful and helpful for me.

          created clock.org file where I will clock all my times in. Better than
          having them merged in the same file with journals.

          as of now, after 3 or so hours, I have deleted clock.org because I have
          found this funcion that allows me to take and log notes together with timestamps
          along the project. thats a good way for now I think.
  - Note taken on [2021-07-27 Tue 12:42] \\
    Every single time I find something useful and implement in emacs org mode -
          ofc it takes time, then all of the suddent I find a video of Reiner Konig
          and my world just flips around. He introduces me to some cool feature that
          kind of make my previous work useless.

          not sure if I should just watch all of his videos and then start configuring
          my emacs or just keep going and do stuff by myself and other resources.

    wow silly me, made some many mistakes trying to make this thing work.
          but now one thing for sure - I will have a separate file with all the journaling
          stuff. easy to input in it - yes.

          one file to put all the time-stamped stuff - easy to put in - yes.

          one place to dump all my thoughts in - gtd.org. easy to put in - lets try,
          give me a moment.

          Ok, back. It works like a charm.

          and one place called - someday/maybe, where I will dump stuff that I dont
          want and need to see on a daily basis. this list of tasks will be cleaned weekly.

          refile - change location of the item c-c c-w and choose a place
          archive - nothing gets deleted c-c c-x c-a
          use template - c-c c

    So its the end of this working day. Spend the whole time, since 10am at the library
          mostly configuring emacs to suite my liking. GTD method with emacs is quite easy and
          I am liking it. Not dependent on evernote or anything like that, can be sure that
          my workflow will remain the same for ears when I finally finish the setup phase, which
          I am getting to an end to.

          Theme - solarized from today. Will try it out. Creator - buddhist dude w/e, probs kept
          an eye on details. Also it doenst strain my eyes so why not.

          Yes, separate files for everything, orgzly on my phone all synced up, reviews are scheduled,
          now all I have to do is stick to my schedules and do the actual work.
  :END:
