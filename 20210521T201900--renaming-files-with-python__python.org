Dude, I just renamed like 30 files wiht a single button click. Python is
amazing. Programming is amazing. This is exactly why I started learning how to
program.. to first of all aid me wiht tasks in my everyday life, then help me
financially in the future and allow me the freedom to travel.

This is great, my first simple, but useful task completed :)

NOTE: Looking at this note on [2023-12-27 Wed], it would have been nice If I
have provided a code snippet that I was so excited about :)
