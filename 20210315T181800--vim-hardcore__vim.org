Some random vim - okay I can not Not share [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c68MkeMBjhE][this]]. During my long pomodoro break
I found this vim shortcut tutorial. Learned a bunch. You can use numbers in the
commands? Mindblown.

I think I will also install some plugins for my vim. Been using it raw since I
first installed it. Making these pages is quite slow when you constantly have
to add paragraphs, make lists, make the text bald and etc, so I think emmet-vim
is a good first pluging for me. Later I would like something that would
auto-correct my text lol since I am still getting used to homerow key typing and
making some mistakes from time to time (although surprisingly no mistakes in
the last sentence :o). Aaand what else. It would be nice to browse throuhgt my
system in vim, to acces files quickly, hm ah yeah, this thing called syntax
highlighting would also be nice. That might be in one of the plugins that the
guy above in the picture has.

You don't imagine how often I think about just using sublime or some other code
editor environment where everything looks so nice and colorful. But then I
remember all those hardcore dudes on youtube that tell you to use vim, since
after climbing that steep learning curve it's all smooth sailing from there. I
wouldn't want to believe them blindly, but when I am using octave for example
or some other program, can't remember which, AND I get to use the same keybinds
like in vim or in linux in general, I get shocked! If I learn vim and linux I
can pretty much do and edit stuff anywhere, the workflow will be so smooth! So
yeah, sticking with vim for now, will try to get some plugins, maybe it will
make my experience more enjoyable :)
