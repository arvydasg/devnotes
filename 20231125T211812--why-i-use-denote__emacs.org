* Why Denote
So last week I have decided to get to know to Denote package. Having lots of
free time, I realized that I do not like my notes structure. Maybe Denote will
help with that.

I can say that the best introduction to Denote is here -
https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-06-18-denote-demo/. By the Denote package
author himself. It is nice to use the tool that was created by the person I
"know". Also the great docs here - https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote

* Process of transferring my life to Denote

This whole Denote setup has taken way more time and effort than I expected.
Reinstalling Emacs to a newer version, then fixing wsl - [[file:20231128T164359--wsl-glitches-in-gui-applications__wsl.org][reporting bugs to
Microsoft's wslg team]], [[file:20231211T151427--first-nixos-installation__nixos.org][remaking my linux/emacs configuration with nixos]],
[[file:20231126T012052--make-denote-faster-on-wsl__emacs_rsync_scripting_wsl.org][making denote run quickier]], transporting all my notes to denote style notes(is
what I am doing right now, for the last couple of days)... Okay, my notes are
quite valuable to me, so let's try to create a website out of them with Emacs.
Now I just have to figure out how which website creation method is the best for
me:
- Must use emacs, right? [[file:20231215T140448--why-build-a-website-with-emacs-and-not-with-something-else__emacs_websites.org][why build a website with emacs and not with something else]]
- Checking my previous blogs I have created with Emacs, their configs, content
- Looking for inspiration in other places - [[file:20231214T150411--inspirational-websites__emacs_websites.org][inspirational websites]]
- Try easy hugo maybe? [[file:20231215T101410--create-a-blog-with-emacs-easy-hugo__emacs_hugo_websites.org][create a blog with emacs-easy-hugo]]
- Ox_hugo maybe? [[file:20231215T203400--create-a-website-with-ox-hugo__emacs_hugo_websites.org][create a website with ox hugo]]
- Org static blog maybe? [[file:20231219T051943--build-a-website-with-emacs-and-org-static-blog__emacs_websites.org][build a website with emacs and org-static-blog]]
- Px-publish maybe? [[file:20231217T064942--build-a-website-with-emacs-and-ox-publish__emacs_websites.org][Build a website with emacs and ox-publish]]
- Finally decided how I will build it - [[file:20231215T182523--building-development-notes-website-with-emacs__emacs_websites.org][building development notes website with
  Emacs]]

I of course had to write down all the steps I took into separate denote pages,
so that we work on that knowledge base you know.

Then I also have to transfer all of my notes from various places(previous
blogs, my work notes, etc..) to denote to have them all in one place,
everywhere :)

* Finally done

So to simply use Denote I had to go over many many steps as you can see :D It's
funny. Many Yaks have been shaved during this process.

Overall, I am happy with the result.
