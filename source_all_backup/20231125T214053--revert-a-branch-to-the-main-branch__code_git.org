Make sure everything is pushed up to your remote repository (GitHub):

~git checkout main~

Overwrite "main" with "better_branch":

~git reset --hard better_branch~

Force the push to your remote repository:

# dont forget the -f when pushing!!!!!!!!1
~git push -f origin main~

# now you have a nice and clean branch just like the branch you copied
# from.
