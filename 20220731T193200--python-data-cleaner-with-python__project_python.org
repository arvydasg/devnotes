* Intro

Clean up exported excel document up and properly format it so it can then be
exported to a .txt file that can later be used with PHATS software.

* What is it for

- A program called Wise exports an excel document with lots of part numbers.
- My script takes this excel document, removes unnecessary part numbers(defined
  in another file) and outputs a .txt file that I can later use for software
  called PHATS. This tool is crucial, prevents a lot of manual labor.

Making functions.py file as an executable so it is more convenient for
operators to use this script(double click it and go).

* Libraries used

- openpyxl
- pandas
- tkinter
- os
