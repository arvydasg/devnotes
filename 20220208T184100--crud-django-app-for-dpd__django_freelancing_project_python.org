* Intro

This Django app was created for me and my colleagues at [[https://www.dpd.com/lt/lt][DPD]]. Instead of writing
delivered packages/stops/pickups on a piece of paper - do it inside this app. A
perfect way to compare your salary slip to the actual work that you have done.

* What is it for

The couriers are not happy with their salaries, they are not sure if they are
calculated properly according to many factors that DPD tells about. This leads
to couriers writing down numbers of packages they have delivered, collected,
kilometers they have driven and so on.. Every day, after each shift. And all
this additional work and accounting because they can not trust their employers.
I thought I will create this app so it can be used by couriers to track their
data easier and in one place.

* How it works

A user logs in, gets a posibility to add a daily record with all the needed
options for a courier. When he is done, a record is saved. It can also be
edited if needed right on the website, no need to go to the django admin.

This is a django app that is hosted on github and heroku.
