* The problem
Having this problem -
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65086856/wsl2-clock-is-out-of-sync-with-windows

run this in powershell to confirm it:

#+begin_src bash
  Get-Date; wsl date
#+end_src

You will notice two different times. They should be the same.

* Possible solution

Solution is to run =sudo hwclock -s= command. It will sync the time. For that
moment. But time will shift again when I put the laptop to sleep.

I don want to run the command manually each time. I will make a script that
runs this command and put it in =.bashrc= so it automatically runs the script
each time I launch wsl. Should be enough?

[2023-12-10 Sun] sudo hwclock -s is not an option.. it does not always work
when I run it.

* Solution that works best for me now
