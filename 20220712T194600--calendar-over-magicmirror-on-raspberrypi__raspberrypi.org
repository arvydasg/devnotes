* The idea

Found an unused raspberry pi at work. Was wondering what it would be
like to use it for something useful… One of the projects I liked was
“MagicMirror".

What you need:

- Raspberry pi
- Free monitor

Follow a well written tutorial([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYlloiaBINo&ab_channel=BreakItYourself][I watched something like this I think]])
and make it work to your liking.

In case you wonder where to get modules for your MagicMirror - [[https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/3rd-Party-Modules][check]].

Some modules are outdated, so keep that in mind if something does not
work. (like Spanish word of the day in my case. It worked for a month
or so at first).

This setup barely uses any electricity(if your monitor is not super
old), so I would say its quite convenient. We constantly keep an eye
on it.

Currently displaying google calendar and some other relevant
information. Displaying one google calendar that I use together with
my family members so we are all up to date with the upcoming events.

* Future Ideas

One day I want to learn how to work with API’s so I can pull my weight
data from “Google Fit” and display in MagicMirror.

Or… I could scrape cvbankas.lt and make MagicMirror display all the
job adds that contained word “Python” in it.

I have many ideas like such :)
