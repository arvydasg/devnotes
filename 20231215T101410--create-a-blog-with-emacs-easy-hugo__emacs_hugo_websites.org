Here is how you create a blog simply with Hugo - [[file:20231128T133020--create-a-blog-with-hugo__hugo_websites.org][example]]. Unless you like to
write outside Emacs and you like wiring in plain Markdown - go ahead and create
a blog with hugo.

If you want to use Emacs, write in .org syntax AND publish your blog HUGO
STYLE, then there is a package for you -

Have not tried it myself yet(yes, might seem strange, will I might do that in
the future, now simply keeping this as a reference for myself later.
[2023-12-15 Fri] and I am quite happy with my fresh out of the over devnotes
page(the one you are on now.)), I don't really want another dependency managing
my LIFE LONG notes. If it's just for a simple blog that you want to spin up on
the spot, then probably that could work.
