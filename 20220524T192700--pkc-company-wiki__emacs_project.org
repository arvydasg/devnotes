* What is it for

When I came to PKC - there was very little documentation about IT processes. It
had to be documented.

As I was already using Emacs for documenting my work with [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]], I simply
had to make a website for it. The website itself was generated thanks to [[https://github.com/arvydasg/pkc_wiki][this
piece of code]].

I then put this website(html files) on server that is accessible to colleagues
so they can get inspiration whenever needed.

This project was mainly focused to my future colleagues.
