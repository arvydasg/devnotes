#+STARTUP:    overview

Official docs - https://wikemacs.org/wiki/TRAMP

If  you need to edit files as sudo - info how is in the docs above.

First of all, try to connect to the remote machine over shell, eshell or vterm like so:

#+begin_src bash
  ssh username@remotehost
#+end_src

You will get prompted for a password. Enter it and you should be able to connect.

Then open emacs and then let's try to open a file remotely, use the =C-x C-f=

#+begin_src bash
  /ssh:username@remotehost:
  # now  you will get prompted for a password (don't forget : at the end of the remotehost name!!)
#+end_src

=.authinfo= in your home dir will contain your credentials.

=tramp= file in your =.emacs.d= will contain your connection history.
