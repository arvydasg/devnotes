https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Sparse-checkouts.html

Useful when I wanted to clone only one dir at work from my personal
org notes directory.

- go to src folder and do ~m-x magit-clone-sparse~
- investigate the .git folder, see the content and watch how it updates in next
  steps
- ~m-x magit sparse checkout enable~ (see the changes)
- inside info folder sparse-checkout appeared
- config and index also changed
- ~c-x g~ - go to magit interface
- do ~>~
- ~s~ to set directories(tab to select)
- needed directory is fetched. MAGIC!
- if you do ~s~ again to change dirs - old dir gets removed :o
