* tips
# have a next action for each project IF its active. If not active -
# no states(project, someday) ir pan. Jeigu projektas someday - duok
# state someday.

# Projects
# putting all the projects here, easy to see how many I have and If I
# am woking on them or not
# I have a headline "* projects" with individual projects as
# second-level headlines, sorted (manually and approximately) from the
# most-important to the least important.  To mark  "next action" items I
# just use the TODO keyword.

# Todo
# all tasks here that don't belong to any of the project as of yet.
# Apart from the "*projects" headline, I also have a "*todo" headline,
# where I put all the todo items which are not clearly assignable to a
# specific project (or when I simply don't have the time for finding the
# appropriate project to put them under).  Once every while, I go
# through the "*todo" hierachy and move some items into the appropriate
# projects.  Sometimes groups of entries in the "*todo" hierarchy evolve
# to the point of becoming a separate project by themselves.  This might
#  look like a mess, but actually it allows me to spend more time doing
# things than organizing them.
